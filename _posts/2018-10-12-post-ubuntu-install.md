### This stuff will make your life easier after installing Ubuntu 16.04.

***



#### FB Reader
- My favourite all purpose document reader, works out of the box & complements the pre installed the document reader.

Installation instructions:

``` bash
sudo apt install fbreader
```
---

#### Zeal
- Zeal is a offline documentation browser for software developers.

Installation instructions:

```bash
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:zeal-developers/ppa
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install zeal
```
---

#### Visual Studio Code
- Visual Studio code's reputation precedes it's name. 
- Fast, lots of extensions and a vibrant community what's not to love.

Installation instructions are detailed [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/linux).

#### Nemo
- Nemo is a file browser from Cinnamon, not unlike the inbuilt file browser.
- That said, it has subtle improvements, such as per folder view preferences, and multiple view filters.

This post is a work in progress, I'll keep adding stuff as and when it strikes me.
